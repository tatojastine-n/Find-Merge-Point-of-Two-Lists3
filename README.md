# Find-Merge-Point-of-Two-Lists3 This C# program defines a singly linked list structure and prepares to implement a function that finds the merge point (intersection) between two linked lists.
It includes classes for nodes and lists, as well as helper methods to insert and print nodes, but the `findMergeNode` function is left to be completed.
